The Executive Council will schedule district wide meetings of DPAC representatives, the Superintendent and/or designate at least three times each school year.

Article VIII: Committees

Special committees may invite representatives of other stakeholder groups to join, as participants or observers, when agreed to by a majority of Executive Council.
Executive Council may form working committees (e.g., bylaws development) from time to time.

Article IX: Leave of Absence
An Executive Council member may request a leave of absence for reasons other than running for office (See Article XI section 11). This leave of absence may be granted by a majority vote of members at an Executive Council meeting. A leave of absence is normally not granted for a period of longer than two months.
An Executive Council member on leave of absence may not act or speak as a district parent during their leave of absence.

Article X: Perception of Bias
Perception of bias refers to a situation that may exist if an individual who represents DPAC Executive Council to the Vancouver School Board, an external organization or the general public is also an employee or elected official of any school board. There may be a perception that they are not speaking solely in the interest of parents and this may diminish the power of what is said.
The chairperson or vice-chairperson of DPAC Executive Council may not be an employee or an elected official of School District # 39. This restriction does not apply to other members of the DPAC, but no DPAC member may represent parents on any administrator selection committee or on any VSB standing or representational committee on which their employee group (e.g., VSTA, VESTA, VEPVPA, VASAA, CUPE, IUOE, VMREU etc.) is entitled to representation.

Article XI: Code of Conduct
Executive Council members direct any criticism of the action of another Executive Council member to that member first, and then if necessary, after informing that individual, may direct the criticism in confidence to the chair and/or vice-chair.
A DPAC representative or Executive Council member who is approached by a parent with a concern is in a privileged position and should treat such discussion with discretion, respecting the confidentiality of the people involved.
Executive Council members may indicate that they are speaking as a district parent to VSB and community committees and the media only when they are reflecting an opinion adopted by a majority of Executive Council members at an Executive Council meeting. If an Executive Council member is writing a letter to the editor, they may only sign it with their title if they are stating an official Executive Council position.
As soon as any Executive Council member is nominated as a candidate for political office (e.g., school trustee, city councilor, MLA, MP) they must take leave from their position as district parent in order to maintain the integrity and political neutrality of the DPAC. If the Executive Council member is elected to public office, they shall resign from the Executive Council.
As terms of their leave of absence, the district parent/candidate shall:
turn over to the DPAC coordinator their list of PAC chairs/addresses. They will not use information from this confidential list in any way in their campaign.
withdraw from all DPAC functions during their leave (e.g., attendance at PAC meetings as an area district parent, attendance at DPAC meetings, etc.). The district parent will refer any phone requests from area PAC chairs to fellow area district parents.
refrain from using their title as DPAC member in any way during the campaign; they may only indicate as background information that they are a district parent on leave.
The DPAC shall be non-partisan politically, as shall its members when speaking/acting on its behalf.

Article XII: Indemnification
Executive Council members shall be indemnified for any costs, expenses or liabilities necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding in which they are made a party by reason of being or having been a member serving in an elected or appointed capacity. No Executive Council member shall be indemnified when judged in the action or suit to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of duty.

Article XIII: Parliamentary Authority
The rules contained in 21st Century Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the organization in all instances when they are applicable and not inconsistent with these bylaws and any other special rules the organization shall adopt.

Article XIV: Amendment of Bylaws
These bylaws may be amended by a two-thirds vote of Executive Council members, providing that the notice of amendment was given at a previous Executive Council meeting and printed/circulated in the minutes of that meeting. All bylaw amendments are subject to ratification by a 2/3 vote of school DPAC representatives present and voting at the area meeting following the DPAC executive decision. If not so ratified, the amendment is deemed rescinded.
